    <h1>Attendance Policy</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p>Consistent attendance and punctuality are essential for maintain=
ing operational efficiency and teamwork at Trivium. This policy outlines ou=
r expectations regarding attendance, leave planning, and communication of a=
bsences, as well as the procedures for tracking attendance in office and re=
mote work settings.</p>
<h2 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-WorkingHours">Working Hours</h2>
<p>Employees must adhere to the official hours of 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, inclu=
ding a one-hour break.</p>
<h2 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-WorkingHoursExpectations">Working Hours Expectat=
ions</h2>
<p>Employees are expected to work an average of <strong>8 net hours daily</=
strong>, regardless of whether they are <strong>working from the office, re=
motely, or from home (WFH).</strong> Any shortfall in hours on a given day =
must be made up within the same workweek unless otherwise approved by their=
 supervisor.</p>
<h2 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-ImportanceofAttendance">Importance of Attendance=
</h2>
<p>Regular attendance is critical to <strong>individual performance and the=
 overall success of the organisation. Every employee is responsible for man=
aging</strong> their attendance to minimise disruption to their team and en=
sure smooth workflows across the organization.</p>
<p>Adherence to this policy contributes to an efficient, respectful, and pr=
oductive work environment and reflects an employee=E2=80=99s commitment to =
their role. It is important to note that excessive absences, including thos=
e resulting in <strong>Loss of Pay (LOP)</strong>, may impact the employee=
=E2=80=99s performance evaluation and can have consequences for the followi=
ng salary increment.</p>
<p>By maintaining regular attendance and adhering to company guidelines, em=
ployees play a key role in driving Trivium=E2=80=99s success.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-PunctualityandAttendanceCommitment">Punctuality =
and Attendance Commitment</h2>
<p>Every employee is expected to adhere to high punctuality and regular att=
endance standards. Your presence and timeliness ensure that responsibilitie=
s are fulfilled without disrupting the workflow. Unplanned or frequent abse=
nces can negatively impact both the team and ongoing projects.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-AttendanceTrackingProcedures">Attendance Trackin=
g Procedures</h2>
<h3 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-WhenWorkingfromtheOffice">When Working from the =
Office</h3>
<p>Employees must <strong>clock-in upon entering the office and clock-out u=
pon leaving.</strong> This ensures accurate tracking of attendance and work=
ing hours.</p>
<p>Employees must <strong>clock-in and clock-out every time</strong> they <=
strong>leave the premises</strong>, whether for a break, official purposes,=
 or any other reason. This ensures accurate attendance tracking, compliance=
 with organisational policies, and <strong>fulfillment of net daily working=
 hour requirements</strong>.</p>
<h3 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-WhenWorkingRemotely">When Working Remotely</h3>
<p>Employees must login and logout using the <strong>mobile application</st=
rong> to record attendance. Failure to record attendance through the app wi=
ll result in being marked <strong>Absent</strong> for that day.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-AttendanceRegularization">Attendance Regularizat=
ion</h2>
<p>Employees will receive an <strong>email notification</strong> for attend=
ance regularization in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <strong>Absent</strong> the previous day.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If the <strong>required working hours</strong> for the previous day were=
 not met.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Under these circumstances, employees must regularise their attendance by=
 either Applying for leave if they are absent or providing a valid reason f=
or the shortfall, which their manager must approve.</p>
<p>Suppose an employee fails to meet the attendance requirements or takes u=
napproved leave. In that case, the shortfall may result in salary deduction=
s unless otherwise regularized and approved by their manager.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-Leaves">Leaves</h2>
<h3 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-NoticePeriod">Notice Period</h3>
<p>Employees must plan <span class=3D"inline-comment-marker" data-ref=3D"75=
286a3b-91e1-4595-9560-603adcf8c07b">their</span> leave in advance, providin=
g <strong>at least two weeks advance notice</strong> for planned leaves.</p=
>
<h3 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-UnplannedAbsences">Unplanned Absences</h3>
<p>In cases of unforeseen circumstances, such as illness or personal emerge=
ncies, employees are required to:</p>
<p>Please notify your Immediate Supervisor and HR by phone or e-mail at lea=
st one hour before the start of your workday. Text messages, e-mails or not=
ifications <strong>via colleagues will not</strong> be considered formal no=
tifications.</p>

<h2 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-UnauthorisedAbsences">Unauthorised Absences</h2>
<p>Unauthorised absences=E2=80=94failure to communicate as per the outlined=
 procedures=E2=80=94will lead to disciplinary action. Repeated occurrences =
may result in formal warnings and affect performance evaluations.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id=3D"AttendancePolicy-LeaveExhaustionandDeduction">Leave Exhaustion an=
d Deduction</h2>
<p>Suppose an employee has used all their available leave and requires addi=
tional time off. In that case, the excess will be automatically deducted as=
 a <strong>Loss of Pay (LOP)</strong>, calculated based on the <strong>Gros=
s Salary</strong>. The deduction will be reflected in the following month's=
 salary. Employees are responsible for monitoring their leave balance and e=
nsuring that planned absences do not exceed it.</p>
